# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv", colClasses=c("numeric", "Date", "numeric"))
splitData <- split(data$steps, data$date)
sums <- sapply(splitData, sum, rm.na=TRUE)

```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
The mean and median is calculated next
```{r}
mean(sums, na.rm=TRUE)
median(sums, na.rm=TRUE)
```

The following is a histogram of the total steps each day.
```{r}
require(ggplot2)
qplot(sums, binwidth=500, xlab="steps")
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
plot.ts(data$interval, data$steps, xlab="Interval", ylab="Steps", xy.lines=TRUE)
```

## Imputing missing values
The number of rows with missing values.
```{r}
sum(is.na(data$steps))
```



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
